# Querycasts Lab

The **Querycasts Lab** is a software development environment for [Querycasts](http://www.querycasts.com/) students. It uses the fantastic projects [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) to run a virtual computer inside your own computer. By using the Lab, you can develop software in the exact same environment as all the other students, regardless of what type of computer you're using. The Lab is also the basis of the development environment for Querycasts's video lessons.

## Installation

Installing the Lab takes a few steps, but they're all pretty easy.

1. Download and install the latest version of [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for your operating system.
